# Programming language

A programming language is a type of written language that tells computers what to do. Examples are: Python, Ruby, Java, JavaScript, C, C++, and C#. Programming languages are used to write all computer programs and computer software. A programming language is like a set of instructions that the computer follows to do something.

## Types of programming languages

The programming languages are broadly classified into three types,

- Low-level language
- High-level language
- Middle-level language

## Low-level language

- It is machine-dependent.
- It works based on the binary number 0’s and 1’s.
- The processor runs low-level programs directly without the need of a compiler or interpreter so the program written in low-level language can be run very fast.

Low-level language is further divided into two parts

## 1) Machine Language

- Machine language is also called machine code or object code.
- Machine language is easier to read because it is normally displayed in binary or hexadecimal form (base 16) form.
- It does not require a translator to convert the programs because computers directly understand the machine language programs.

## 2) Assembly Language

- Assembly language is designed for specific processors.
- It represents the set of instructions in a symbolic and human-understandable form.
- It uses an assembler to convert the assembly language to machine language.

## High-level programming language

- High-level programming language (HLL) is designed for developing user-friendly software programs and websites.
- This programming language requires a compiler or interpreter to translate the program into machine language (execute the program).

Example: Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP, C#, C++, etc.

A high-level language is further divided into three parts -

## 1) Procedural Oriented programming language

- Procedural Oriented Programming (POP) language is derived from structured programming and based upon the procedure call concept.
- It divides a program into small procedures called routines or functions.

Example: C, FORTRAN, Basic, Pascal, etc.

## 2) Object-Oriented Programming language

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language is based upon the objects.
- In this programming language, programs are divided into small parts called objects.
- It is used to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, etc in the program to make the program reusable, efficient, and easy to use.

Example: C++, Java, Python, C#, etc.

## 3) Natural language

- Natural language is a part of human languages such as English, Russian, German, and Japanese.
- It is used by machines to understand, manipulate, and interpret human language.

## Middle-level programming language

- Middle-level programming language lies between the low-level programming language and the high-level programming language.
- It is also known as the intermediate programming language and pseudo-language.
- A middle-level programming language's advantages are that it supports the features of high-level programming, it is a user-friendly language, and is closely related to machine language and human language.

Example: C, C++, language
