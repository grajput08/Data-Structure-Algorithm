# Comments

Comments are hints that a programmer can add to make their code easier to read and understand. They are completely ignored by C++ compilers.

There are two ways to add comments to code:

- Single Line Comments

- Multi-line Comments

## Single Line Comments

Any line that starts with // is a comment. For example,

```C++
// declaring a variable
int a;

// initializing the variable 'a' with the value 2
a = 2;
```

## Multi-line Comments

Any line between /_ and _/ is also a comment. For example,

```C++
/* declaring a variable
to store salary to employees
*/
int salary = 2000;
```
