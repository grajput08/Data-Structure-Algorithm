# Variables

Variable is a name a given to a memory location.

```c++
int age = 14;
```

## Rules for naming a variable

- A variable name can only have alphabets, numbers, and the underscore **\_**.
- A variable name cannot begin with a number.
- It is a preferred practice to begin variable names with a lowercase character. For example, **name** is preferable to **Name**.
- A variable name cannot be a keyword. For example, **int** is a keyword that is used to denote integers.
- A variable name can start with an underscore. However, it's not considered a good practice.
